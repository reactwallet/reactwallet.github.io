# React Wallet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reactwallet/reactwallet.github.io.svg?branch=source)](https://travis-ci.org/reactwallet/reactwallet.github.io)

React Wallet is deployed for demo purposes at https://reactwallet.github.io/.

This is an MVP for a web app made with React and Redux. It is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com).

In the app we can add and store multiple accounts each with its own balance and its own currency. Each account can be opened by clicking on it and we can `Deposit` and `Withdraw` funds from them as well as `Transfer` to another account. Accounts are grouped into a few predefined group categories.

The currency for the first account we create will be set as a default currency and will be used for calculating the balance for each group and the total balance from all available accounts. Currency rates are fetched from the [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) when the app is loaded or when an account with a new currency is added.

All actions and data are saved in the `localStorage` so that everything is available after refreshing the browser. The `History` page shows all actions that we've made. And the `Settings` page has an option to change the default currency and for removing everything from the state and the localStorage.

Tests are incomplete and shown just as an example.

**Dev note**: Because the app is deployed in Github Pages as a user page (i.e. `https://reactwallet.github.io` rather than `https://ishristov.github.io/reactwallet`) the page must be served from the `master` branch. That's the reason the source files are currently in the `source` branch and the `master` contains the `build` folder that is generated after running `npm run build`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in dev mode (auto reloads on file changes and shows lint errors in the console).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

There are only a few simple tests for showing the setup.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

This setup uses the default config from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If any customization is needed, we can `npm run eject` which will remove the single build dependency from the project.

Then it will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into the project so that we have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts.

There is no need to use `eject` if we are happy with the default config.
